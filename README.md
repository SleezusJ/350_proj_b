In this project we built out the functions:
printChar(), printString(), readString(), readSector(), and handleInterrupt21().

These functions can be tested by commenting/uncommenting the driver code left in main(), re-compiling, and running in Emumaker86.

The only thing not complete as of now (10/29/19 08:44) is readString(). It doesn't stop when backspaced past the beginning of the line.
